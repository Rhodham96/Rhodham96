# Rhodham96's GitHub Page

Welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹

This repository serves as the main entry point to my GitHub profile, where I showcase my projects, experiments, and contributions in software development. Here you'll find a collection of my personal and collaborative work, including code samples, open-source tools, and more.

## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Rhodham!
Iâ€™m a passionate and hands-on AI engineer in training, with a strong background in programming, data science, and automation. I thrive on solving real-world problems through code, and I enjoy turning ideas into smart, efficient systems. My interests span from software engineering and web development to deep learning, robotics with Arduino/Raspberry Pi, and cloud-based automation.

Iâ€™m currently sharpening my skills through projects involving computer vision, generative models (like GANs and transformers), and building end-to-end AI pipelines â€” often integrating APIs, orchestrating workflows with tools like Power Automate, and deploying with frameworks like FastAPI and TorchServe.

Whether itâ€™s contributing to open-source, participating in hackathons, or preparing for a role in AI or data science, I bring creativity, curiosity, and a builderâ€™s mindset to everything I do.
